= Usine

As I'm learning IO language, I wanted to experiment the possibilities of the language by rewriting something I'm familiar with and having dynamic stuff involved. FactoryGirl ( http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl ) has both. 

=== Experiment explanation

FactoryGirl declare patterns to craft ActiveRecord ( persisted in DB Ruby object ) used to simulate real-data while writing tests. Usine just craft vanilla objects in a similar fashion. 

=== Notes 

* I'm still new to IO, implementation may have bugs, weird issues, 
* There's not real test suite, it's just an experiment. Once I've found some interesting stuff to map objects to, maybe to some Mongo db, Usine will make more sense than now. 

=== Thanks 

* jer and people on #IO IRC channel for giving feedback on my code
